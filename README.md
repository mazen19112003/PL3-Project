<h1>shopping project<h1/>
<h4>Objective: Create a virtual store management system using F#.
Build a simple store simulation where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and 
calculate total costs<h4/>

# Features

## 1. Product Catalog (Displayed to User):
- The store will have a list of available products, each with the following details:
  - **Name**
  - **Price**
  - **Description**

- The list of products will be stored in an F# collection (e.g., List or Map) which will be initialized by you in the F# code.

## 2. User Interaction:
- **Browse Products**: The user will be able to view the products available in the store.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can select items by name and add them to their cart.
- **View Cart**: The user can view the items in their cart at any time.
- **Checkout**: Once the user is done shopping, they can view the total price of the items in their cart.

## 3. Cart Management:
- The cart will be represented as a list of product names.
- Users can add and remove products from their cart.
- At checkout, the program will calculate the total cost by summing the prices of the items in the cart.
